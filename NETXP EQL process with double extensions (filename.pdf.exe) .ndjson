The rule looks for processes with filenames containing double extensions, where the second extension appears to be an executable file extension. The example provided as an illustration, suggesting that the rule is particularly interested in filenames that might deceive users by appearing as a benign document (e.g., a PDF file) while actually having an executable extension (e.g., \".exe\"). This naming convention is often associated with attempts to disguise malicious files, prompting the need for further scrutiny or action.\nPoprawiona wersja.", "risk_score": 73, "severity": "high", "license": "", "output_index": "", "meta": {"from": "1m", "kibana_siem_app_url": "https://10.7.1.125:5601/app/security"}, "author": ["Szymon Gluch"], "false_positives": [], "from": "now-1260s", "rule_id": "348d28be-0b40-4848-a7b5-a41e35cadeea", "max_signals": 100, "risk_score_mapping": [], "severity_mapping": [], "threat": [], "to": "now", "references": [], "version": 1, "exceptions_list": [], "immutable": false, "related_integrations": [], "required_fields": [], "setup": "", "type": "eql", "language": "eql", "index": ["logs-*"], "query": "any where process.name regex~ \"^[^.]+[.][a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9]*[.][a-zA-Z]+[0-9]*$\"", "filters": [], "actions": []}{"exported_count": 1, "exported_rules_count": 1, "missing_rules": [], "missing_rules_count": 0, "exported_exception_list_count": 0, "exported_exception_list_item_count": 0, "missing_exception_list_item_count": 0, "missing_exception_list_items": [], "missing_exception_lists": [], "missing_exception_lists_count": 0, "exported_action_connector_count": 0, "missing_action_connection_count": 0, "missing_action_connections": [], "excluded_action_connection_count": 0, "excluded_action_connections": [], "author": ["Szymon Gluch"]}
